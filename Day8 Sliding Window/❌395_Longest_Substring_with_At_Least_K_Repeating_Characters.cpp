// Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.
// Example 1:

// Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
